# Infra as Code Hands-on lab using Terraform

This session will provider an overview of the different options available for provisioning environments on Azure and the pros and cons of each. We will then work through a hands-on lab to create DevOps pipelines to maintain environments in Azure using Terraform.

## Introduction

- [Infra as Code Options](/docs/1.options.md)
- [Terraform overview](/docs/2.terraform-summary.md)

## Labs

### Hands on with the basics

- [Pre-reqs](/docs/3.prereqs.md)
- [Lab 1.0 - The Basics](/labs/1.0/README.md)

- [Lab 1.2 - Not infra, but environment](/labs/1.2/README.md)
- [Lab 1.3 - Deletions](/labs/1.3/README.md)
- [Lab 1.4 - Destroy](/labs/1.4/README.md)

### Making it more usable

- [Lab 2.1 - Outputs]()

### Run as ...

- [Lab 3.0 - Silently run]() # inc. IAM and AAD
- [Lab 3.1 - Shared state]() # inc. modifying provider

### Working as a team
